Intro here.

<h2>Load spike rasters</h2>

The first step is to set up the R environment by clearing the workspace, setting a random-number generator seed, and loading the neurons package.

```{r Rsetup}
# Clear the R workspace to start fresh
rm(list = ls())

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(12345) 

# Load neurons package
library(neurons) 
```
